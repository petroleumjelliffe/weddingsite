<h1>Lauren and Pete are Getting Married!</h1>
[Photo]

<h2>Oh my god, that’s so exciting!
We know, right!  It seems like forever since we met but we’re ready to take the next step.  That is, the next step past moving in together and getting a cat.
When and where are you two lovebirds getting married?
We’re not sure yet! You’ll be the first to find out.   
If you give us your email address, we’ll tell you right away.

<h2>How did Pete propose?</h2>
[short version] [long, boring version]
I’d handle this one, Lauren.  We were in Austin, TX for the Austin City Limits Festival.  We both like Austin and there were some okay bands playing.  

Strolling to the festival grounds on an incredibly hot Saturday morning, I took Lauren aside on Pfluger Pedestrian Bridge.

There, in the shining sun, I took out the ring that I had concealed on my person for 3 straight days, patiently waiting for the right moment.  I said some mushy things, asked Lauren to be my partner for the rest of our lives, and Lauren said “Duh, Yes!”

<h2>That’s sweet.  How did you two meet anyway?</h2>
I’m sure we told you at some point.  But here’s how it really happened:

<h2>Adorable.  I’m so happy for you.</h2>
Thank you!  We appreciate your good wishes!
I’ve never met your future spouse.  What should I say to them?
Here’s a few fun facts about us, so when we meet you’ll already know what we have in common.

By the way, we love Pringles.  What role will Pringles play in the wedding?
Pringles is up for anything.  She’s already got her formal wear picked out, but is having trouble deciding on a hat.
