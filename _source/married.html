<h2>Oh my god, that’s so exciting!</h2>
<p>We know, right!  It seems like forever since we met but we’re ready to take the next step.  That is, the next step past moving in together and getting a cat.</p>

<h2>When and where are you two lovebirds getting married?</h2>
<p>We’re not sure yet! You’ll be the first to find out.   </p>
<p>If you give us your email address, we’ll tell you right away.</p>


<h2>How did Pete propose?</h2>
<p>Would you like the <a>SHORT version</a> or the <a>LONG, BORING version</a> (with photos)?</p>
	 
	<div id="short-version" >
		<h3>short version</h3>
			<p>Pete and Lauren were in Austin, TX for the Austin City Limits [Music] Festival.  We both like Austin and there were some okay bands playing.  Right before they went into the concert grounds on Saturday morning, Pete popped the ol' question right there on Pfluger Bridge.  </p>
			<p>Lauren said &ldquo;Duh, yes!&rdquo; </p>
			<p>We called our parents and siblings.  We cried.  We sweated.  We sweated some more.  (It was 95 degrees, after all). We saw JSBX play to an empty tent.  </p>

	<div id="long-version">
		<h3>long, boring version (with photos!)</h3>
	
		<p>Strolling to the festival grounds on an incredibly hot Saturday morning, I took Lauren aside on Pfluger Pedestrian Bridge.</p>
		<img alt="[map]" src="" width="100%" />
		
		<p>There, in the shining sun, I took out the ring that I had concealed on my person for 3 straight days, patiently waiting for the right moment.  I said some mushy things, asked Lauren to be my partner for the rest of our lives, and Lauren said “Duh, Yes!”</p>

<h2>By the way, we love your cat Pringles.  What role will Pringles play in the wedding?</h2>
<p>Pringles is up for anything.  She’s already got her formal wear picked out, but is having trouble deciding on a hat.  </p>
